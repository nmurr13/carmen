-- Clue #1: We recently got word that someone fitting Carmen Sandiego's description has 
-- been traveling through Southern Europe. 
-- She's most likely traveling someplace where she won't be noticed, 
-- so find the least populated country in Southern Europe, and we'll start looking for her there.

SELECT MIN (population) FROM country WHERE region ='Southern Europe';
SELECT * FROM country WHERE population=1000;

-- Clue #2: Now that we're here, we have insight that Carmen was seen attending language classes 
-- in this country's officially recognized language. Check our databases 
-- and find out what language is spoken in this country, so we can call in a translator to work with you.

SELECT * FROM countrylanguage WHERE 'VAT' = countrycode;

-- Clue #3: We have new news on the classes Carmen attended: our gumshoes tell us 
-- she's moved on to a different country, a country where people speak only the language she was learning. 
-- Find out which nearby country speaks nothing but that language.

SELECT * FROM countrylanguage WHERE 'Italian' = language ORDER BY percentage DESC;
SELECT * FROM country WHERE code ='SMR';

-- Clue #4: We're booking the first flight out: maybe we've actually got a chance to catch her this time. 
-- There are only two cities she could be flying to in the country. One is named the same as the country â€“ 
-- that would be too obvious. 
-- We're following our gut on this one; find out what other city in that country she might be flying to.

SELECT * FROM city WHERE countrycode = 'SMR';
